This bash script creates a basic Spring Boot application that mimics the structure and some of the functionality of the TIBCO project. However, it's a starting point and requires significant further implementation to fully replicate the TIBCO project.  The script includes:

*   Directory creation.
*   pom.xml with essential dependencies (Spring Data JPA, JMS, Web, Oracle JDBC, Lombok, Commons CSV, Spring Integration).
*   application.properties with JMS and database configurations (placeholders).
*   Basic Spring Boot application, listener, service, controller, entity, and repository classes.
*   A basic unit test.
*   Maven commands to compile and run the project.

**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

*   **Implement Business Logic:** The `CreditMaintenanceService` and `CreditMaintenanceListener` classes have `TODO` comments. You need to implement the core business logic, including flat file parsing, data validation, transformation, database updates, and JMS message sending.
*   **Database Configuration:** Replace the placeholder database URL, username, and password in `application.properties` with your actual database credentials.
*   **JMS Configuration:** Verify the ActiveMQ broker URL and credentials.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
*   **Logging:** Add more detailed logging to track the execution flow.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all the business logic.
*   **File Parsing:** Implement the flat file parsing logic based on the `CC2_Credit_Maintenance_File.sharedparse` and `CC2_Credit_Maintenance-FF.sharedparse` formats.
*   **Data Transformation:** Implement the data transformation logic to convert the flat file data into the XML format required by the "cloud" system.
*   **Spring Batch:** Consider using Spring Batch for more robust and scalable batch processing.
*   **Security:** Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
*   **CLE Integration:** Implement the CLE (Common Logging and Exception handling) integration.
*   **Message Format:** Ensure the message format sent to `M.MKT.CC2.CUSTOMER.CLOUD.MTNC.ACCOUNT` matches the expected format of the receiving system.
*   **Re-process and Error Handling:** Implement the logic for writing and re-processing error records.

This script provides a foundation. The most challenging part is implementing the actual business logic based on the TIBCO project analysis.
